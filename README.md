# rekordboxcleanup
Some scripts to help with managing a rekordbox collection. 

In general this is not (yet) usable as a normal python package with executable. Probably I'll do it at some point, but 
for now this is only the public collection of the code I use regularly.  

# Installation 
Just clone this repository. 
 
# Usage 
I'm using `click`, so you can simply use `python rekordbox.py --help` or (for example) 
`python rekordbox.py trackswithoutplaylist --help` to know more about the usage of the command. 

Rekordbox itself is closed and doesn't offer any API. But regarding the library there is one way out, 
and one way back in. They are not that convenient, but it's enough to do the job. 

So all the commands work in this way. 

## 1. Export library in XML 
By using *File->Export Collection in XML Format* you can export an XML file which contains everything from your library, 
except the music files themselves. 

## 2. Run command 
Run the command you want with the XML file as parameter, perhaps adding an output filename. 

## 2. Re-Import Playlist
Rekordbox can show you an external XML library. For this you have to configure two things in the rekordbox preferences:  

* View: under *Layout*, enable *rekordbox xml* 
* Advanced: under *Database* and *rekordbox xml* set *Imported Library* to the output library path. I usually use the 
  same name all the time. 
  
Now in the list of sources you will find the XML, including a new playlist. This playlist you now can drag&drop to your 
normal library, and voilÃ . 


# Commands 
## `trackswithoutplaylist`
```bash
> python rekordbox.py trackswithoutplaylist --help
Usage: rekordbox.py trackswithoutplaylist [OPTIONS] REKORDBOX_XML
                                          DESTINATION_XML

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
```

Creates a new playlist with all tracks that are not in any other playlist. 

## `findduplicatetracks`
```bash 
python rekordbox.py findduplicatetracks --help
Usage: rekordbox.py findduplicatetracks [OPTIONS] REKORDBOX_XML
                                        DESTINATION_XML

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.
```

Finds duplicate tracks. The resulting playlist contains all the duplicates, sorted. 
The command tries to handle mixes properly,  so "original mix" and "original remix" and so on are treated as the 
same track. 

## `additionalfiles`
```bash
python rekordbox.py additionalfiles --help
Usage: rekordbox.py additionalfiles [OPTIONS] REKORDBOX_XML FOLDER

Options:
  --delete
  --help    Show this message and exit.
```

Finds files in a certain folder that are not in the rekordbox library. With the option `--delete` they are deleted. 

One use-case for me: find duplicate tracks with the other command, delete the duplicates from the library, cleanup the 
files with this command.
